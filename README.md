- 👋 Hi, I’m Jessica Lockhart. I am a PhD student in the Fahrig Lab at Carleton University and a species-at-risk biologist with the Government of Alberta’s Ministry of Environment and Protected Areas.
- 👀 My dissertation investigates how mobility and fecundity influence species’ responses to habitat loss. Its overall aim is to improve our understanding of the mechanisms driving variability in species’ responses to land-use change.
